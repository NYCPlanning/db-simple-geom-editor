# simple-geom-editor
A Simple Leaflet Draw GeoJSON creator that outputs a terminal command to make a geojson file

##Why
We needed an absurdly simple way to add new geometries to a postGIS database. The user creates their geometry, copies and pastes the command in their terminal, and then runs a python script to acutally update the geometries later.
